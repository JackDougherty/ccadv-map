## TO DO
- confirm that Kelly wants dual interface: hover over polygons and click on points
  - contrast with clickable points and polygons https://jackdougherty.github.io/otl-redlining/index-frame.html
  - check all names and file structure; confirm if umbrella-north-haven (or new-haven)
- clarify how to display long names inside the info box
- teach Kelly how to make her own fork, add and edit files
