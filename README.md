## Live map (insert your own link)
- http://jackdougherty.github.io/ccadv-map/index.html

## Credits
- modified by Ania Aliev, DataViz intern at Trinity College CT, and Jack Dougherty
- from http://jackdougherty.github.io/leaflet-map-polygon-hover/index.html

## How to create your own on the web
- Create a fork (copy) of this map to your own GitHub account
- Publish with GitHub Pages feature (see http://DataVizForAll.org)

## How to download and edit files
- anyone can click green download to zip file button
- see two key data files
  - polygons.geojson
  - points.geojson
- drag and drop either geojson file into http://geojson.io to edit, use the Table tab, or click on item in map to edit
- keep the "name" consistent across both files, and also items in the charts and facts subfolders
- to change "full name" edit both points and polygons; to change web address only, edit points only

## Notes
- if CCADV makes changes to their version of the data files or code, it will NOT necessarily be identical to Jack's version
- Points.geojson contains general locations inside polygons (41.74, -72.67), NOT exact locations of specific buildings
